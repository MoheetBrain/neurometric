MoheetBrain is a Computational Psychology Engine designed to debug and measure human psychological states and compare them to reality (maths).

Instead of treating emotions as "feelings" to be felt, it treats them as System Error Signals (Prediction Errors, Entropy Spikes, Homeostatic Deficits) to be solved mathematically.


Mathematical Core (Equations).
